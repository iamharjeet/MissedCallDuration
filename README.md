# MissedCallDuration
# Description

Missed Call Duration is an ad free app. It shows you the duration of your missed calls.
Do you ever wonder about how long your phone was ringing when you missed a call? 
Or does someone call you only for a few seconds and then hang up? Then this app might be useful to you.
Now you can know who gave you only a missed call OR a long ring duration could mean an urgent call you missed.
When you get a missed call, this app will keep track of the time and duration and will optionally notify you.

# Notice
Due to changes since Android 9, Google put restrictions on reading call logs for non-dialer apps.
So, the app can no longer read the contact number of the caller. It only shows the time and duration of the missed call.
Users now have to cross check with their phone call history to know the contact number of the missed call.
Unfortunately, there is no work-around this problem for the time being. All the negatives reviews are due to this problem, post Android 9.
