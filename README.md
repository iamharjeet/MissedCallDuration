# MissedCallDuration
Missed Call Duration is an AD FREE app and will forever remain AD FREE.

It shows you the duration of your missed calls.

Do you ever wonder about how long your phone was ringing when you missed a call? Or does someone call you only for a few seconds and then hang up? Then this app might be useful to you.



Now you can know who gave you only a missed call OR a long ring duration could mean an urgent call you missed.

When you get a missed call, this app will keep track of the time and duration and will optionally notify you.
